# **App Name**: Indie TMDB

## Core Features:

- TMDB API Cloning: Clone data from TMDB API for specific movie and TV show IDs using endpoints like /movie/{movie_id} and /tv/{tv_id} with comprehensive append_to_response parameters. Use a tool to incorporate any or all returned data as needed.
- Automated Data Import: Automatically import data from a sequence of TMDB movie IDs (e.g., https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1 to infinity), process each entry, and save the data.
- JSON Data Provider: Provide cloned TMDB data via a custom API, structured to match the original TMDB API format.
- Admin Panel: Provide an interface to monitor import progress, manage data sources, and trigger manual data cloning tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to reflect the vastness of the cinematic universe, chosen because a media database has associations with content of high cultural value.
- Background color: Very dark indigo (#1A237E), part of a dark color scheme to focus attention on the visual content.
- Accent color: Deep purple (#7E57C2) for interactive elements and highlights, to contrast well with the dark indigo and add a touch of sophistication.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif well-suited for body and headlines in an informative web app.
